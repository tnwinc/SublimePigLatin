# Sublime Pig Latin Translator

Translates English to Pig Latin.

## Installation

Open Terminal and run the following:

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages && git clone git@github.com:tnwinc/SublimePigLatin.git

## Setup

The default key binding is:

    super+alt+ctrl+t

To set your own, create a key binding for `pig_latin`, like so:

    { "keys": ["super+alt+t"], "command": "pig_latin" },

## Usage

You can use the translator in 2 ways:

* select the text you wish to translate and hit the key binding
* if the text you wish to translate is between quotation marks (single or double), simply put your cursor within the quotation marks, hit the key binding, and everything between the quotation marks will be translated
